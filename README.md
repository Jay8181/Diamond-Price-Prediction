# About the Dataset
Gemstones like diamonds are always in demand because of their value in the investment market. This makes it very important for diamond dealers to predict its price. In this repository , Iâ€™ll walk you through a task of Diamond Price Prediction with machine learning using Python.

# Dataset

The dataset used is [Diamond Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) from Kaggle.
The Price of the Diamond is to be estimated based on different features like cut, color, clarity, carat and other features

# Models Used:
For this dataset, linear regression and RandomForest Rergression has been used:
## Linear Regression:
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable.
## Random Forest Regression:
Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.
A Random Forest operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees
